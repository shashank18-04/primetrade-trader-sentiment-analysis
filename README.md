# Trader Performance vs Market Sentiment Analysis

## Objective
Analyze how Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear/Greed) impacts trader behavior and performance on Hyperliquid.

## Methodology

- Segmented traders by frequency, size, and consistency
- Proposed sentiment-aware strategy recommendations

## Key Findings
- Profitability and volatility increase during Greed regimes
- Fear triggers significantly higher trading activity
